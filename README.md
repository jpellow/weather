# weather application

THis basic weather application will tell you your current weather and the 5 day forecast based on the city you input.

The default City is set to Austin. As you type in more cities theyw will populate on the left hand side so they can be brought up later.

The cities you search for get saved into Local storage and be displayed upon site refresh.

I was unable to finish the UV and icons so you will have to use your imagination. The plan was to use an if statment to check the weather description and put an icon in according to the weather that day.

The site is not Mobile-first
